(Other GHC/Cabal version combinations that are known to work are 9.6/3.8 and 9.8/3.10.
You can also check the version combinations we test [in GitHub Actions](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/meet/blob/main/.github/workflows/build.yml).)

cd meet
cabal install
```

## Usage

This package provides two executables: **`meet`** and **`meet-rooms`**.
The former is used to find a meeting time for a group of people (and associated meeting rooms), whereas the latter just shows room availabilility.

You can use the `-h` flag to get help on how to use each of these executables:
